# When we are dealing with Time and Space complexities we would always see the following three Greek letters: Omega Theta and O (Omicron).

List :
Ω-----θ-----O
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

# There is no best O complexity or Average 0 complexity all type of complexities are divided in the following three:

- **"Best"** Omega (Ω) is the lower bound of an algorithm. It is the tightest bound on the running time of an algorithm. It is the best possible time complexity that an algorithm can have.

- **"Average"** Theta (θ) is the tight bound of an algorithm. It is the average running time of an algorithm. It is the average time complexity of an algorithm.

- **"Worst"** O is the upper bound of an algorithm. It is the loosest bound on the running time of an algorithm. It is the worst possible time complexity that an algorithm can have.
