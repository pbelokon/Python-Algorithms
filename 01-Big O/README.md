# Big o

## What is Big O Notation ?

Big O notation is a way of describing the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow.

## What type of complexities are there ?

There are 2 types of complexities:
-- Time Complexity
--- Time Complexity is the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as the size of the input increases.
--- In is not measured in time but in the number of operations that it take to compleat something.
-- Space Complexity
--- Space Complexity is the amount of memory an algorithm takes to run as the size of the input increases.

## Which one is better ?

Well it depends on the situation. If you have a lot of data and you need to find something in it, you would want to use a faster algorithm (Time Complexity). If you have limited memory and you need to find something in it, you would want to use an algorithm that uses less memory (Space Complexity).
